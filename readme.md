# Knights Travails

A program that finds the shortest path for a knight to move between two positions on a chessboard.

Finds the shortest path for a knight to move from a starting position to a target position on an 8x8 chessboard. It implements a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves of the knight and determines the minimum number of moves required to reach the target.
